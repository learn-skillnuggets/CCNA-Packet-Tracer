LAB 02: IPv4 ADDRESSING AND SUBNETTING

EXAM TOPICS COVERED:
- 1.6 Configure and verify IPv4 addressing and subnetting
- 1.7 Describe the need for private IPv4 addressing
- 1.10 Verify IP parameters for Client OS (Windows, Mac OS, Linux)

OBJECTIVES:
-----------
1. Configure IPv4 addresses on router GigabitEthernet interfaces
2. Understand subnet masks and their CIDR notation (/24, /30)
3. Configure default gateways on end devices
4. Verify connectivity between different subnets
5. Interpret IP addressing information from show commands
6. Understand the purpose of /30 subnets for point-to-point links

TOPOLOGY:
---------
Refer to Lab02_Topology.pdf for the visual diagram.

Network Design:
- 3 routers in a triangle topology
- Each router has a LAN segment with 2 PCs
- Router-to-router links use /30 subnets to conserve addresses

EQUIPMENT REQUIRED:
-------------------
- 3 x Cisco 2911 Routers
- 3 x Cisco 2960-24TT Switches
- 6 x PCs
- Straight-through Ethernet cables
- Crossover cables
